## Projects
Here lies the Projects that have been crafted during my time learning and hoaning my skills as a Java Developer.  
Hopefully these projects give a good blend between my personality, creative, coding style, skills, and knowledge.

## Instructions
Each folder is its own project.  Whichever is your preferred IDE should allow you to select and open each folder separately
as it own project.  All the necessary files should be in each project folder to allow it to run as is and as intended independently.
If you are using VS-Code all required folders and files are included to run the program properly and is my preferred method as that
is the program that was used to create most of the projects and files.  Thank You, and Enjoy!

coding equations and understanding how to solve problems and what different types of methods even existed.
