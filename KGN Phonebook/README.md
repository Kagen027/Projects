## Welcome

KGN Phonebook (My First ever Java Project)

## Info

This Project was created to act as a phonebook/addressbook within the terminal.  My preffered method of running the application is through Bash or ZSH
within linux terminal by navigating to the bin directory and running Java directly.  This option give the application a more complete feeling of what it was created
for and the invornment it was designed to run in.  Second to that would be VS-Code, because the intergrated terminal can imulate Bash or ZSH with full funtionality
of clearing the terminal after completing actions and giving a more complete and visually appealing experience.  It will run in Eclipse but won't give full experience
as eclipse Terminal doesn't run and register all commands like a true Terminal.    

## Assignment Instruciton

Test case :
John Doe, 114 Market St, St Louis, MO, 63403, 6366435698
John E Doe, 324 Main St, St Charles, MO,63303, 8475390126
John Michael West Doe, 574 Pole ave, St. Peters, MO, 63333, 5628592375
Note: Test cases should work when copy and paste into the console as one entry (as is).
 
Searching for John should return a list of all 3 records above, displaying the telephone number in this order (636)-453-8563.

## Functionality

This is a beginner level project that still has room to grow.  If the Application is used within it intended funtionallity and instruction
it will run perfectly.  The intention is for the application to run and save all contacts until the application is terminated.  With that being
said there are ways to break the application and cause it to end premeturally.  Which will allow for further expermentation and learning as new
skills are learned and honed in on to prevent premeture termination.

•  Add New Contact, you can copy multiple contacts and paste them in all at once as long as they are typed out and copied in the propper format.
•  Delete A Contact that is no longer needed in the phonebook
•  Update a contact to new infomration or change to completley different contact if desired
•  Search the phonebook to view all contacts, or return specified criteria EX: State, city, name, area code, whatever you want to search
•  Give an option to terminate the application
