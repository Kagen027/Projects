## INFO

•  The README.md files within the folders are the assignment details given to me to better understand what I was asked to do and why I made my Code the way I did.

•  The Abstract Lab was more of a step by step assignment to learn Abstract Classes and Interfaces.

•  Lab 1 Application.java is all of the Classes combined into one file to be turned in more conveniently with each question commented in the methods.

•  Lab 2 is split into each method being its own class and each class having comment section for the assignment questions.

•  Lab 3, 4, & 5 each only have one Java class with the assignment completed within that one class.
